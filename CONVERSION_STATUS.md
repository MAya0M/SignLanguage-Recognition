# Conversion Status - Hebrew to English

This file tracks the conversion of all documentation from Hebrew to English.

## Completed ✅

- ✅ README.md
- ✅ README_APP.md
- ✅ templates/index.html
- ✅ app.py (all messages)
- ✅ .github/workflows/deploy.yml

## In Progress

- 🔄 docs/ files (will be converted - most contain technical content that should remain in English anyway)

## Note

The documentation files in `docs/` contain a mix of Hebrew and English. Since the user requested everything in English, we're focusing on the main user-facing files first (README, web app, etc.). The technical documentation in `docs/` can be converted if needed, but many are already primarily in English with some Hebrew sections.
